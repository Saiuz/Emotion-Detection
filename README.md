# Emotion Detection (tutorial)
The goal of this repo is to teach people about how they can use computer 
vision techniques to accurately classify facial emotions. I've tried to make it as easy as possible
to follow my code by heavily documenting it (probably over documenting it), and putting it in notebooks.
If you want to learn about the basics of opencv, Convolutional Neural Networks, 
or just want a fun project idea, you're in the right place.

Although you can learn most of the techniques in this project on the fly. 
There are some things that I recommend you have if you want to get the most out of the project.
- Intermediate knowledge of python
- Basic high level knowledge of Neural Networks
- Familiarity with the concept of threading
- Decent computer, Nvidia GPU is a big bonus
- Ability to make many angry looking faces for the system to train on

## Project Description/Goals
Obviously I'm trying to create a system to classify emotions on someones face, so here's the plan.
1. Capture video camera feed
2. Extract faces from the video camera images
3. Use a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the emotion on the face
4. Make our own face/emotion dataset to train the Neural Network on
5. Use the classification to do something? Change Hue lights?
