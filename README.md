# Emotion Detection (tutorial)
The goal of this repo is to teach people about how they can use computer vision techniques to accurately classify facial emotions.
If you want to learn about the basics of opencv, Convolutional Neural Networks, or just want a fun project idea, you're in the right place.

Although you can learn most of the techniques in this project on the fly. There are some things that I recommend you have if you want to get the most out of the project.
- Intermediate knowledge of python
- Basic high level knowledge of Neural Networks
- Familiarity with the concept of threading
- Decent computer, Nvidia GPU is a big bonus
- Ability to make many angry looking faces for the system to train on
